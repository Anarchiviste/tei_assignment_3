    "Once a girl knows I'm going to
    listen to a no, she knows I'm
    going to listen a yes, too.
    That yes is a really nice thing
    to hear when she means it. Not
    just about sex...About
    anything."

It is up
to each of us
to prevent
sexual
assault
in our
community
2. Help a survivor

    Believe what your friend is telling you.
    Dont pressure or force them to do
    anything. They need to feel they are
    in charge of decisions.
    Tell your friend that the rape is NOT
    their fault. Do not blame your friend
    for what happened.
    Don't question their behavior or
    reasons.
    Ask them how you can help, ask them
    what they want.
    Encourage them to go to a hospital
    to get a rape kit done.
    Rape is a crime, encourage them to
    report it.
    Encourage them to think about talking
    to a counselor.
    Support your friends. Listen to
    their story and their needs. Don't
    be judgmental.

3. What to do if...
you or a friend are
sexually assaulted

    Go to a safe place. With people
    you feel comfortable with.
    Go to a hospital right away for a rape kit; DO NOT bathe, douche,
    shower, or change clothes before
    hospital visit. Cleaning, although
    that may be your first instinct,
    will destroy evidence that could
    be used if you decide to prosecute
    the offender.
    Talk to a legal advocate to decide
    whether or not you should file a
    report.
    Utilize the resources in your
    community to help you cope with the
    assault.
    Remember ! The rapist is entirely responsible
    for a rape. A survivor
    is never at fault or to blame,
    regardless of the situation.
    If your friend has been assaulted,
    stand by them, listen and do anything
    you can to help.

5.1. Take care of yourself

- Communicate with your partner. Ask
questions to make sure the two of
you see eye to eye. Really listen
to what your partner says, it's
easy to hear what you want instead
of what they are saying. Strop right
away if they say 'no' at any time.

- Be smart about alcohol. It's much
easier to be a victim or predator
when you're trashed.

- Consent CANNOT be given while
drunk, high, passed out or
emotionally distressed.

- Be clear and assertive. If there is
any misunderstanding stop teasing     
say no. Respect yourself, it's
always OK to say no. It's OK to
change your mind. Sex is never an
obligation.

- Remember; there is no way that
anyone can dress that invites
harrassement.

- Avoid any situation you're not
completely comfortable with, and
don't be afraid to leave any
situation that you feel is shady.
5.2. Take care of your friends

- Keep an eye on your friends. Don't
be afraid to step in and intervene
if they are in a risky or bad
situation.

- Making your presence know will let
your friend know that they are not
alone and the person bothering them
may back off.

- Check in with your friends. If you
sense that they are uncomfortable
with what's going on, step in and
make sur everything is alright.

- If your friends are acting sketchy
or aggressive giving people
unwanted/inappropriate attention.
don't be afraid to distract them or
get them out of the situation. Be
sure to let them know that their
Behavior was unacceptable.

    A friend of mine

    someone, and I feel

    trust ?

    When I hear about a rape close to me, I

    I could have done anything to prevent
    it.
