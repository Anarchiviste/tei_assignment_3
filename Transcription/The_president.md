The president is Gone
And other notes
from the future
Angélica
2023

1.

The president
is gone.

And the vice
president is gone
too.

We created a
world where

we didn't need
these false idols.
2.

The priest is gone.
The missionaries are
all gone too.

We didn't need them
telling us what to do.

We decided to do some
thinking for ourselves.

So now

The police are gone,

The [sheriff] and
deputies and hey
the criminals are
all gone too.

Theres no jails and
no prisons, no heartless

warehouses full of
people, living breathing.

We didn't want those things
anymore. So we

Got rid of all our bosses,
we all quit our "jobs"

and realized we could actually find our purpose...
3.

We got
rid of the
Landlords ... it

wasn't there land
to "lord" anyway ...

and we got rid of
renters too.

Now were all just
livers... livers ?

Haha ... I mean were
all people who get
to be alive,

People who get
to experience our
world

and not just
fight to survive it.
4.

So we got rid of
the corporations.
That's right.

Now
the CEOs are gone
and the shareholders
and investors and
even the consumers are gone too.

We got rid
of them when

They were
treating the
rest of the
world like a
game ...

They
played by unfair
rules...

So we burned
the rule book

And the game board,
all the cards and
the dice,

and we got rid
of the markets
and the money and

we started valuing
people ...animals ...plants ...
the world ...

For what they are :

Gifts ... Blessigngs ...
not from any
of us ...
to all of us ...

Gifts.
5.

So we got rid
of the food prices
and the "cost" of healthcare and

decided to live in
abundance. We
stopped putting a
price tag on life.

So we got rid of
the rich. And we
got rid of the
poor. We decided
that we all could
do more...

We got rid of
the borders and
walls... The binary
structures that kept
us apart...

We realized
how fragile they were,
how easily they could
crumble.

They
didn't
stand
a
chance
against
the power we had ...

That we still have.

The power of love ...
creativity ...solidarity

We never once surrendered.
6.

So now the hatred
is gone.
The silence and
shame too.

We got rid
of them; we
loved to hard !

In the best way
possible. We
embodied our truths.

We didn't let lies
stop us. So we
got rid of the
mass media and
the legislators are
all gone too !

We got rid
of the teachers, there
are no more of them
and we got rid of
the students too.

We realized we have
lots more fun when
we all become
learners, creators, participants
in our reality and
not mere predefined roles.

And we were so
successful !
We still are.
7.

And now the
violence is all
gone,

and the
tanks and guns
are gone too.

The gas is gone,
the bombs, the
chemicals they
dumped into the
earth our home.

They are all gone.

We got rid of them !

Chose life,

Chose love, chose connection
instead of fear.
8.

We chose
each other.
And we still
do. That's
how we
made it so
far.
9.

But we looked
beyond ourselves
too and we chose
the world, again
as it is, gifts,
glorious and
abundant and
we realized we had
so much we were
missing.

So we
don't have the
scarcity the
fear and coercion
any more.

No more
extraction and
expansion and
exploitation     
that's all gone.
We embraced
cycles
and
transitions,
trangressions,
transformations,

We got rid
of control
and welcomed
in community.
And we thrive,
and we thrive,
and we thrive,
and we thrive.

They may burn our books
but we will
still
write
more.
