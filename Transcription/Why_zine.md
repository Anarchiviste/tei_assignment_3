1. Why zines work

    What is a zine ?

    A zine is a booklet
    made by a transgender
    anarchist who doesn't have
    any other options.
    The Zine is a format
    that's good at containing
    information.
    A zine is a unit, a thing,
    a piece of information.
    A zine is, specifically,
    a chunk of information.
    It is made of + 7 smaller
    chunks of information.

    A page folded thrice makes
    for eight portions; six
    smaller pages and cover :
    this is the classic format.

    WHen Doesn't it Work ?

    My last issue was a moment's
    musing about pet play.
    People liked it! My previous
    was about a much more
    interesting topic I've been
    researching for a long time,
    and nobody cared. *

    Why did one work, and the
    other didn't ? I think it was
    the format.
    I broke the format with the
    flop : it was a double issue.
    Double was too much ! Even I
    got bored in the middle.
    I should have listened to
    Miller and his famous laws.

    The Law of Exactly Sevenish

    Seven has been a number of
    magical and cosmic signifiance
    for all of human history.
    Especially 1956. That's when
    George Miller wrote
    The Magical Number 7, +2.
    The paper exemplains why you can
    remember a telephone number
    but not a credit card number.

    I think Miller's Law is about more than just human short    term memory. What if it applies not to just our brains, but information itself ? What if it's part of a general information theory that we don't have yet ?Regardless, it applies to zines.

    The Theory of Memes

    Before it was rare Soyjaks, the meme was a serious theory by Dawkins '76. He named memetics following genetics, including select    tion. But his evolutionary metaphor didn't even apply to evolution. Don't get me wrong, I like his theory (and evolution.) But Dawkins called a meme a unit of culture. Sounds squishy, doesn't it ? Let's call it instead a chunk of information. Even better, a mirrorable chunk of information : one that can be easily repeated..

For us, by Xerox.

    The Mirroring Section

    I guess that makes this the mirroring section. The mirroring Section. You may have heard of mirror neurons      they're a useful discovery that's become something of a meme !
    This is the monkey see; do network in your brain. It means that the Xerox in our brain is essential to learning and being : we copy, we become. Likewise inform    ation copies and becomes.

So what does the mirror network mirror, anyway ? ... "Phenomena ?" I think it deals in chunks.

    Shrink To Grow

    Notice that you don't have to read Miller Dawkins and ... uh, Rizzolatti to follow me. That's because their books compress into my mini-page chunks. The behavior of the chunkd is what mattered to Miller, not the number. They compress, nest, and scale.

    Scaling means that the riot [girl] concept can go from zine idea to cultural Thing. If copied and shared, the information you're reading could compress-nest-scale, too. It would no longer be 6 chunks about Miller, mirroring, and memetics. It would become one idea, a Zine Theory, told in one word: zinetics.

THE FORMAT (that functions)

    I. A zine is one page with zevenish parts.
    II. A zine is black and white.
    III. A zine is cheap or free.
    IV. A zine photocopies easily.

THE FILLING (that fucks)

    A zine does not sell cheeseburgers.
    A zine is small, below and against.
