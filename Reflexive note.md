# Relexive note on TEI and ODD costumisation

At the beginning of this year, I found TEI a bit overly complex, but it was practical for having a common foundation for everyone encoding text. 
The first iteration with the DTD was honestly fun, and it was interesting to consider how to encode the form and meaning of my document.

The second iteration with TEI was frustrating because of the sheer volume of documentation TEI requires reading to determine if a tag is actually used for its intended purpose. There were plenty of tags for encoding the form of the text, but not the physicality of the copy. I had to use workarounds like external authority lists for certain elements. 

The third iteration with an ODD schema was much more interesting because I was able to both identify logical problems in my previous encoding methods and resolve the rule issues that were leading me to cobble together a flawed encoding.

This also led me to think about how I structured my work. Do I write very strict rules that only allow work on zines from my specific perspective? Or do I create something with guides and recommendations, and let potential users utilize both the tools I provide and the other tools available in the TEI (Theory of Educational Innovation)? In this project, I chose the second option.
